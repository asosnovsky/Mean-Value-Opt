# Title: Mean Variance Optimization, Problems and Suggested Solutions
## Authors: Ariel Sosnovsky, Vicktoria Tran, Kosal, Yossif Bisk
### Summary:
	Mean variance optimization is a theory created by Henry Markowitz in 1952, for portfolio optimization. This theory has been widely criticized by many statisticians and economics for some of the assumptions that it assumes. 
	As will be shown in this paper, the underlying issues that the assumptions of the model bring, are presented when the model is applied to a wide complete market. However, these problems become less severe as we reduce the intervals of time and increase the number of optimization instances.
