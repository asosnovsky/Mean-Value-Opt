\section{Data Collection}

\subsection{Data Origin}
For this project, we decided to use real market stock data collected from the Yahoo Finance website. Below are a list of conditions imposed on the data and their justification. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item 2008-2012
\begin{itemize}
\item data was collected \textit{daily} for the period of Jan 2008 to Dec 2012
\item data would be fail to incorporate any large financial shocks (2008 financial crisis), thus the returns should have relatively low variance
\end{itemize}
\item Stocks by Sector
\begin{itemize}
\item stocks were organized into the following sectors: Basic Materials, Conglomerates, Consumer Goods, Financial, Healthcare, Industrial Goods, Services, Technology and Utilities according to Yahoo Finance classification
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
